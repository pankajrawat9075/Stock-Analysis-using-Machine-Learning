# Stock-Market-Prediction-with-ML
This was our Major Project of BTech and I worked in a Team of 4 to create this Project. We were able to predict correct results with deviation of 5 to 7 percent with 80 percentage accuracy. 
Using various ML tools, We analyzed the Stock Data of various companies and used the analysis along with ML algorithms like LInear Regression and KNN Regressor to predict future Prices.
